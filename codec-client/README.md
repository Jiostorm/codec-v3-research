# Game Elements of CodeC

Hi, readers!

This contains the game elements used in CodeC for the research conducted by Jobb Rodriguez, George William Sison, and Sukhraj Takhar.

They are advised by Joshua Martinez.

Heads up:
1. Sensitive code (like APIs) were secured to protect the code's confidentiality.
2. Compilation was removed in `pages/r/_room/live-coding.vue` to focus on the Live Coding feature.
